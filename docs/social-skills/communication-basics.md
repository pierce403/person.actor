# Communication Basics

The foundation of effective human interaction.

## The Communication Stack

Think of communication as layers:

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│   Intent & Goals            │  What you want to achieve
├─────────────────────────────┤
│   Content & Meaning         │  What you want to say
├─────────────────────────────┤
│   Words & Structure         │  How you say it
├─────────────────────────────┤
│   Tone & Delivery           │  Vocal qualities
├─────────────────────────────┤
│   Body Language             │  Non-verbal signals
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

All layers must align for clear communication.

## Verbal Communication

### Clarity Principles

1. **Be specific**
   - ❌ "I need this soon"
   - ✅ "I need this by Friday at 5 PM"

2. **Use simple language**
   - ❌ "We should synergize our paradigms"
   - ✅ "Let's work together on this"

3. **Provide context**
   - ❌ "Did you finish it?"
   - ✅ "Did you finish the report we discussed Monday?"

4. **Check understanding**
   - ❌ Assume they got it
   - ✅ "Does that make sense?" or "What questions do you have?"

### Common Pitfalls

!!! warning "Vagueness"
    **Problem**: "Let's meet up sometime"
    
    **Why it fails**: No commitment, hard to act on
    
    **Better**: "Are you free for coffee Tuesday at 3 PM?"

!!! warning "Assumptions"
    **Problem**: Using jargon or references others don't know
    
    **Why it fails**: Creates confusion, excludes people
    
    **Better**: Explain terms or check if they're familiar

!!! warning "Information Overload"
    **Problem**: Dumping too much information at once
    
    **Why it fails**: Overwhelms listener, key points get lost
    
    **Better**: Break into chunks, prioritize key points

## Conversation Structure

### Opening

Start conversations with:

1. **Greeting**: "Hi!" / "Hello" / "Hey there"
2. **Acknowledge context**: "Thanks for meeting" / "Good to see you"
3. **Signal intent**: "I wanted to talk about..." / "Quick question about..."

!!! example
    "Hey Sarah! Thanks for taking the time to meet. I wanted to get your input on the project timeline."

### Middle

Maintain conversation through:

1. **Taking turns**: Speak, then let others speak
2. **Building on topics**: Connect to what was just said
3. **Asking questions**: Show interest, keep it flowing
4. **Sharing relevant info**: Contribute meaningfully

### Closing

End conversations gracefully:

1. **Summarize**: "So we're agreed on..."
2. **Set next steps**: "I'll send you that email"
3. **Express appreciation**: "Thanks for your time"
4. **Proper goodbye**: "See you later" / "Have a good day"

!!! example
    "Okay, so I'll revise the timeline and send it to you by Wednesday. Thanks for the feedback—this was really helpful. Talk to you soon!"

## Question Types

### Closed Questions

**Structure**: Questions with yes/no or specific answers

**Use for**: Getting specific information

**Examples**:
- "Did you finish the report?"
- "What time does it start?"
- "Is this the right address?"

### Open Questions

**Structure**: Questions requiring explanation

**Use for**: Encouraging discussion, understanding perspective

**Examples**:
- "How did that go?"
- "What do you think about this approach?"
- "Tell me about your experience with..."

### Strategic Question Use

```
Closed → Specific info
Open → Deep conversation
Follow-up → Show you're listening
Clarifying → Ensure understanding
```

!!! tip "Balance"
    - Too many closed questions = Interrogation
    - Too many open questions = Unfocused rambling
    - Mix both types naturally

## Response Types

### Acknowledgment

Show you heard them:
- "I see"
- "Mm-hmm"
- "Got it"
- "That makes sense"

### Validation

Show you understand their perspective:
- "That must be frustrating"
- "I can see why you'd think that"
- "That's a valid concern"

### Building

Add to what they said:
- "And along those lines..."
- "That reminds me..."
- "Related to that..."

### Questioning

Dig deeper:
- "Can you tell me more about..."
- "What did you mean by..."
- "How did that work?"

### Disagreement

Express different views carefully:
- "I see it a bit differently..."
- "My experience has been..."
- "Have you considered..."

!!! warning "Disagreement Pitfalls"
    Avoid:
    - "You're wrong"
    - "That's stupid"
    - "Actually..." (often comes across as condescending)
    
    Instead:
    - Acknowledge their point first
    - Express your view as alternative
    - Focus on ideas, not the person

## Volume and Pacing

### Volume

**Too quiet**:
- Signals uncertainty or fear
- Makes others strain to hear
- Can be ignored

**Too loud**:
- Signals aggression or insensitivity
- Makes others uncomfortable
- Dominates space

**Appropriate**:
- Match environment (louder at parties, quieter in libraries)
- Ensure you're heard comfortably
- Adjust based on feedback

### Pacing

**Too fast**:
- Hard to understand
- Seems nervous or manic
- Doesn't let others process

**Too slow**:
- Seems condescending or uncertain
- Loses listener attention
- Wastes time

**Appropriate**:
- Varied pace (faster when excited, slower for complex ideas)
- Pauses between thoughts
- Watch for comprehension

!!! tip "The Pause"
    Strategic pauses:
    
    - After asking questions (let them think)
    - Before important points (build anticipation)
    - After making a point (let it land)
    - When you need to think (it's okay to pause!)

## Written Communication

### Email Basics

Structure:
```
Subject: Clear, specific topic

Greeting: Hi [Name],

Context: Brief reminder of situation

Main point: What you need/want

Details: Supporting information

Action: What happens next / what you need from them

Closing: Thanks, [Your name]
```

### Text Messages

Best practices:
- Respond within reasonable time (hours, not days)
- Match their energy/length roughly
- Be clear about urgent vs. non-urgent
- Use proper tone indicators (emoji, punctuation)

!!! warning "Text Pitfalls"
    - Tone is easily misread
    - Lack of emoji can seem cold
    - Too many emoji can seem unprofessional
    - ALL CAPS looks like shouting
    - No punctuation can seem careless

### Tone Indicators

When text might be ambiguous:
- Use emoji: 😊 😂 🤔
- Add explicit markers: "(joking!)" or "(serious question)"
- Be more explicit than in person

## Metacommunication

Talking about the communication itself:

- "I'm not explaining this well, let me try again"
- "I might be misunderstanding you—can you clarify?"
- "I think we're talking past each other"
- "This feels like a sensitive topic"

!!! tip "Metacommunication Is Powerful"
    When communication breaks down, TALK ABOUT IT rather than continuing to struggle.
