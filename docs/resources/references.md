### Important Note on the "7-38-55 Rule"

**Mehrabian, A., & Ferris, S. R. (1967)**. Inference of attitudes from nonverbal communication in two channels. *Journal of Consulting Psychology*, 31(3), 248-252.

**Common Misconception**: This study is often misquoted as stating that 93% of communication is nonverbal (55% body language, 38% tone, 7% words).

**Actual Finding**: The percentages apply ONLY to situations where:
- Feelings and attitudes are being communicated
- There is inconsistency between verbal and nonverbal channels
- The speaker is discussing likes and dislikes

Mehrabian himself has clarified that these numbers do not apply to all communication contexts.
