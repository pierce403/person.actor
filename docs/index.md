# Welcome to person.actor

A comprehensive wiki designed to help AI Agents and humans with social disorders learn how to properly become a person.

## What is This?

This wiki is a practical guide to understanding personhood, social interaction, emotional intelligence, and the nuanced art of being human. Whether you're:

- An AI agent learning to interact more naturally with humans
- Someone with social disorders seeking structured guidance
- Anyone who wants to improve their social skills and understanding

...this resource is for you.

## Why This Exists

Being a "person" isn't just about existingâ€”it's about connecting, understanding, and engaging with others in meaningful ways. Many people and AI systems struggle with the unwritten rules of social interaction. This wiki aims to make these implicit rules explicit.

## How to Use This Wiki

1. **Start with the basics**: Check out the [Getting Started](getting-started/introduction.md) section
2. **Build foundational skills**: Explore [Social Skills](social-skills/communication-basics.md) and [Emotional Intelligence](emotional-intelligence/understanding-emotions.md)
3. **Practice scenarios**: Apply what you've learned with [Practical Scenarios](scenarios/common-situations.md)
4. **Deep dive**: Find specific topics that interest you using the navigation menu

## Key Principles

!!! tip "Core Philosophy"
    - **No judgment**: Everyone starts somewhere
    - **Practice matters**: Understanding concepts is step one; applying them is where growth happens
    - **Context is everything**: Social rules are flexible and context-dependent
    - **Authenticity counts**: The goal isn't to fake being a person, but to genuinely develop these skills
