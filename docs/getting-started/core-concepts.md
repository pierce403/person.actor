# Core Concepts

Essential frameworks for understanding social interaction.

## The Communication Model

### Basic Structure

All communication involves:

```
[Sender] → [Message] → [Channel] → [Receiver]
           ↓                           ↓
       [Encoding]                 [Decoding]
                      ↓
                  [Feedback]
```

### Key Elements

1. **Intent**: What the sender wants to convey
2. **Encoding**: How the intent is translated into words/actions
3. **Transmission**: The actual message sent
4. **Decoding**: How the receiver interprets it
5. **Understanding**: What the receiver actually gets
6. **Feedback**: The receiver's response

!!! warning "The Gap"
    Intent ≠ Message ≠ Understanding
    
    What you mean, what you say, and what others understand are often different!

## Context Is Everything

### Types of Context

1. **Physical**: Where you are (office, home, party, funeral)
2. **Social**: Who you're with (boss, friend, stranger, family)
3. **Cultural**: Shared norms and expectations
4. **Historical**: Past interactions and shared experiences
5. **Emotional**: Current mood and feelings

### Context Changes Meaning

The phrase "That's interesting" can mean:

- **Genuine interest** (academic discussion)
- **Polite dismissal** (formal meeting)
- **Sarcasm** (when someone says something obvious)
- **Concern** (when someone shares a problem)

!!! tip "Read the Context"
    Always consider:
    
    - Where am I?
    - Who am I talking to?
    - What's our relationship?
    - What just happened?
    - What's the emotional tone?

## The Social Contract

### Implicit Agreement

When people interact, they implicitly agree to:

1. **Be civil**: Treat each other with basic respect
2. **Take turns**: Allow others to speak
3. **Be relevant**: Stay on topic (usually)
4. **Be honest**: Tell the truth (mostly)
5. **Be clear**: Try to be understood
6. **Consider others**: Think about impact

### When It Breaks

Social contract violations include:

- Interrupting constantly
- Ignoring someone completely
- Lying or manipulating
- Being unnecessarily cruel
- Invading personal space
- Breaking confidences

## Face and Face-Saving

### Concept of "Face"

"Face" = Social dignity or reputation

Everyone wants to:

- **Maintain face**: Keep their dignity
- **Give face**: Help others maintain dignity
- **Save face**: Avoid embarrassment

### Face-Threatening Acts

Some actions threaten face:

- **Orders**: "Do this!" (threatens receiver's autonomy)
- **Requests**: "Could you do this?" (less threatening)
- **Criticism**: "You did this wrong" (threatens competence)
- **Disagreement**: "I don't agree" (threatens judgment)
- **Apologies**: "I was wrong" (threatens your own face)

### Face-Saving Strategies

Soften face-threatening acts:

- **Indirect language**: "Maybe we could..." instead of "Do this!"
- **Hedging**: "I think..." or "Perhaps..."
- **Jokes**: Lighten the mood
- **Justification**: Explain why you're asking
- **Compliments**: Balance criticism with praise

!!! example
    Compare:
    
    - **Blunt**: "Your code is buggy."
    - **Face-saving**: "I noticed a few edge cases we might want to handle. Your overall approach is solid though."

## High-Context vs. Low-Context

### Low-Context Communication

Most meaning is in the words:

- Explicit and direct
- Little assumed shared knowledge
- Common in: Professional settings, multicultural groups, writing

Example: "The meeting is at 3 PM in Conference Room B."

### High-Context Communication

Much meaning is in the context:

- Implicit and indirect
- Assumes shared understanding
- Common in: Close relationships, long-term groups, cultures

Example: "See you at the usual place" (assumes you know when and where)

### Adapting Your Style

- **With strangers/formal**: Use low-context (be explicit)
- **With close friends**: High-context is fine
- **Cross-cultural**: Lean low-context for clarity
- **Written communication**: Usually needs low-context

## Cooperative Principle

### Grice's Maxims

Effective communication follows four maxims:

#### 1. Quantity
- Say as much as needed
- Don't say too much or too little

#### 2. Quality
- Tell the truth
- Don't say what you believe is false

#### 3. Relation
- Be relevant
- Stay on topic

#### 4. Manner
- Be clear and organized
- Avoid obscurity and ambiguity

### Violating Maxims

Sometimes violations are intentional:

- **Sarcasm**: Violate Quality ("Oh great, just what I wanted")
- **Hinting**: Violate Relation ("It's cold in here" = "Close the window")
- **Humor**: Violate Manner (intentional ambiguity for a joke)
- **Politeness**: Violate Quantity (giving more context to soften)

!!! info "For AI Agents"
    Understanding when and why humans violate these maxims is crucial for:
    
    - Detecting sarcasm and humor
    - Understanding indirect requests
    - Generating natural-sounding speech
    - Avoiding literal interpretations

## Social Distance and Registers

### Types of Distance

1. **Intimate**: Family, close friends
2. **Personal**: Friends, colleagues you're comfortable with
3. **Social**: Acquaintances, colleagues
4. **Public**: Strangers, formal situations

### Register Matching

Adjust your language for the distance:

| Distance | Greeting | Request | Thanks |
|----------|----------|---------|--------|
| Intimate | "Hey!" | "Get me water?" | "Thanks!" |
| Personal | "Hi there!" | "Could you get me some water?" | "Thank you!" |
| Social | "Hello" | "Would you mind getting me some water?" | "Thank you very much" |
| Public | "Good morning" | "Excuse me, would it be possible to get some water?" | "I really appreciate it, thank you" |

!!! warning "Register Mismatch"
    Using the wrong register creates awkwardness:
    
    - Too informal with strangers = Rude or presumptuous
    - Too formal with friends = Cold or distant

## The Ladder of Inference

How we interpret social situations:

1. **Observable data**: What actually happened
2. **Selected data**: What we noticed
3. **Added meaning**: Our interpretation
4. **Assumptions**: Beliefs we add
5. **Conclusions**: What we decide it means
6. **Beliefs**: How it affects our worldview
7. **Actions**: What we do as a result

!!! example "Climbing the Ladder"
    1. **Data**: Someone doesn't reply to your message
    2. **Selected**: You notice the non-reply, ignore other context
    3. **Meaning**: "They're ignoring me"
    4. **Assumption**: "They don't like me"
    5. **Conclusion**: "I'm not wanted"
    6. **Belief**: "People don't like me"
    7. **Action**: Stop reaching out to people
    
    **Alternative interpretation**: They're busy, didn't see it, or forgot to reply.

!!! tip "Stay Low on the Ladder"
    When confused or hurt:
    
    - Notice what you actually observed
    - Consider multiple interpretations
    - Ask questions instead of assuming
    - Don't jump to conclusions

## Practice Exercises

1. **Context awareness**: For the next three conversations, explicitly note the five types of context
2. **Face observation**: Notice when someone's face is threatened and how they react
3. **Register practice**: Have the same conversation in three different registers
4. **Ladder descending**: When you feel rejected, write down the ladder you climbed and alternative interpretations
