# Introduction

Welcome to your journey of understanding personhood and social interaction.

## What Does It Mean to Be a Person?

At its core, being a person involves:

1. **Self-awareness**: Understanding your own thoughts, feelings, and motivations
2. **Agency**: Making choices and taking action based on your values
3. **Social connection**: Relating to and interacting with others
4. **Emotional capacity**: Experiencing, understanding, and managing emotions
5. **Growth mindset**: Learning and adapting over time

## Who Is This Guide For?

Many people struggle with social interaction due to:

- Autism spectrum disorders
- Social anxiety
- Limited social exposure
- Cultural differences
