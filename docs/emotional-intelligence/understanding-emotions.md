    You can model these as:
    - **Valence**: Positive/negative
    - **Arousal**: High/low energy
    - **Function**: What the emotion motivates
    
    Example: Fear = Negative valence, high arousal, motivates avoidance

## Emotion Dimensions

### Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions

Emotions exist on a wheel with:
- **Opposites**: Joy ↔ Sadness, Trust ↔ Disgust
- **Intensities**: Rage → Anger → Annoyance
- **Combinations**: Joy + Trust = Love, Anticipation + Joy = Optimism

### Valence and Arousal

Two-dimensional model:

```
         High Arousal
              |
    Angry • • • • Excited
         •   |   •
    Tense• •   • • Happy
         •   |   •
Negative ----+---- Positive
         •   |   •
     Sad • • | • • Content
         •   |   •
   Bored • • • • Calm
              |
         Low Arousal
```

## How Emotions Work

### The Emotion Process

1. **Trigger**: Something happens
2. **Perception**: You notice it
3. **Appraisal**: You interpret it
4. **Emotion**: Feeling arises
5. **Expression**: Shows in behavior
6. **Response**: You act on it

!!! example
    1. **Trigger**: Dog runs toward you
    2. **Perception**: You see/hear it
    3. **Appraisal**: "Is it friendly or aggressive?"
        - If friendly → Joy
        - If aggressive → Fear
    4. **Emotion**: Fear arises
    5. **Expression**: Wide eyes, tense body
    6. **Response**: Step back or run

### Appraisal Is Key

**Same trigger, different appraisals, different emotions**:

**Event**: You don't get invited to a party

**Appraisal A**: "They don't like me" → Sadness
**Appraisal B**: "How dare they!" → Anger
**Appraisal C**: "Makes sense, we're not close" → Indifference

### Emotions Happen Fast

- Primary emotional response: ~milliseconds
- Conscious awareness: ~seconds
- Full processing: minutes to hours

You often feel before you know why.

## Functions of Emotions

Emotions aren't random—they serve purposes:

### Information
- Tell you what matters
- Signal when things align or clash with goals/values
- Highlight important events

### Motivation
- **Fear**: Avoid danger
- **Anger**: Address injustice, defend boundaries
- **Sadness**: Withdraw and process loss
- **Joy**: Continue rewarding behaviors
- **Disgust**: Avoid contamination

### Communication
- Signal your state to others
- Elicit responses (crying brings comfort)
- Build social bonds

### Decision-Making
- Guide choices ("gut feelings")
- Provide rapid assessments
- Highlight what's important

!!! tip "Emotions as Data"
    Treat emotions as information:
    
    - **What is this feeling telling me?**
    - **What need or value is involved?**
    - **What does it want me to do?**
    
    Then decide whether to act on it.

## Emotional Regulation

**Emotional regulation**: Managing emotions adaptively

### Healthy Regulation

- **Feel it**: Allow the emotion
- **Understand it**: What's it about?
- **Express it**: Appropriately
- **Act wisely**: Choose response

### Unhealthy Regulation

- **Suppression**: Push it down (causes problems later)
- **Explosion**: Let it all out unchecked (damages relationships)
- **Rumination**: Dwell on it excessively (intensifies it)
- **Avoidance**: Refuse to feel it (prevents processing)

### Regulation Strategies

**Before emotion arises**:
- **Situation selection**: Avoid triggers
- **Situation modification**: Change the situation
- **Attention deployment**: Focus elsewhere
- **Cognitive reappraisal**: Reinterpret the meaning

**After emotion arises**:
- **Response modulation**: Change expression/behavior
- **Acceptance**: Allow without judgment
- **Expression**: Share appropriately
- **Soothing**: Self-comfort

!!! example "Reappraisal"
    **Situation**: Boss gave you critical feedback
    
    **Appraisal 1**: "They hate me" → Anxiety, shame
    **Reappraisal**: "They're helping me improve" → Motivation
    
    Different interpretation → Different emotion

## Reading Emotions in Others

### Facial Expressions

Universal signals:
- **Happiness**: Raised cheeks, crow's feet, smile
- **Sadness**: Downturned mouth, drooping eyelids
- **Anger**: Lowered brow, pressed lips, tense jaw
- **Fear**: Raised brows, wide eyes, open mouth
- **Surprise**: Raised brows, wide eyes, dropped jaw
- **Disgust**: Wrinkled nose, raised upper lip

### Body Language

- **Posture**: Slumped (sad), expansive (confident), contracted (afraid)
- **Movement**: Agitated (anxious), sluggish (depressed), energetic (excited)
- **Tension**: Relaxed vs. tense

### Voice

- **Volume**: Louder when angry/excited, quieter when sad/ashamed
- **Speed**: Faster when excited/anxious, slower when sad/tired
- **Quality**: Shaky when afraid, choked when sad

### Context

Always consider:
- What's happening?
- What might they be feeling?
- Is this emotion appropriate to context?

## Responding to Others' Emotions

### General Principles

1. **Acknowledge**: Show you notice
2. **Validate**: Show the feeling makes sense
3. **Support**: Offer appropriate help
4. **Don't fix**: Unless asked

### Response by Emotion Type

**Anger**:
- ✅ "You have every right to be upset"

- ✅ Give space if needed
- ❌ "Calm down" or dismiss their concern

**Fear/Anxiety**:

- ❌ "Don't worry" or "That's silly"

**Joy**:

- ❌ Diminish or one-up their joy

!!! warning "Common Mistakes"
    - **Toxic positivity**: "Just be positive!"

    - **Comparison**: "Others have it worse"
    - **Fixing**: Offering solutions instead of listening
    - **Invalidating**: "You shouldn't feel that way"
